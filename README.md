**Fonts**: 
- The main font Raleway was chosen for being a clear, aesthetic and readable font.
- The secondary font Playfair Display was used to create the logo for having an elegant feeling.

Both fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

**Colors**:
To give the project a clean look, the main colors chosen were off-black and off-white, with two shades of blue-green to emphasize some areas like the shop now button.
